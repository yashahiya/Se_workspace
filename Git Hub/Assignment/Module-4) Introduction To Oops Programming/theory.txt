1. Key differences between POP and OOP

Procedural Programming focuses on functions and sequence of steps.
OOP focuses on objects that contain data and functions together.
POP is less secure, while OOP supports better security and reusability.

2. Advantages of OOP over POP

OOP provides data hiding using encapsulation.
It supports code reusability through inheritance.
Programs are easier to maintain and scale.

3. Steps to set up a C++ development environment

Install an IDE like Dev C++ or CodeBlocks.
Set up a C++ compiler (GCC/MinGW).
Write, compile, and run a C++ program.

4. Main input/output operations in C++

cin is used to take input from the user.
cout is used to display output on the screen.
Both are defined in the <iostream> header.

5. Data types in C++

C++ has basic data types like int, float, double, and char.
Derived data types include arrays, pointers, and references.
User-defined types are struct, union, enum, and class.
bool is used for true/false values.
Example: int a = 10; float b = 2.5; char c = 'A';

6. Implicit vs Explicit Type Conversion

Implicit conversion is done automatically by the compiler.
Example: float x = 10; (int to float).
Explicit conversion is done manually by the programmer.
It uses type casting like (int) or static_cast.
Example: int y = (int)3.7;

7. Types of operators in C++

Arithmetic operators: + - * / %.
Relational operators: > < >= <= == !=.
Logical operators: && || !.
Bitwise operators: & | ^ << >>.
Example: if(a > b && a != 0).

8. Constants and literals in C++

Constants are fixed values that cannot be changed.
They are declared using the const keyword.
Literals are actual fixed values used in programs.
Examples of literals: 10, 3.14, 'A', "Hello".
Example: const int PI = 3.14;

9. Conditional statements in C++

Conditional statements are used to make decisions in a program.
if-else executes code based on a true or false condition.
Example: if(marks > 50) pass else fail.
switch selects one case from many options.
It is mainly used for menu-driven programs.

10. Difference between for, while, and do-while loops

for loop is used when the number of iterations is known.
while loop is used when iterations depend on a condition.
do-while loop executes at least once.
Condition is checked before execution in for and while.
Condition is checked after execution in do-while.

11. break and continue statements

break is used to exit a loop immediately.
continue skips the current iteration.
break stops loop execution completely.
continue moves control to the next iteration.
Example: if(i==5) break;

12. Nested control structures

Nested control structures mean one control statement inside another.
Commonly used with loops and conditional statements.
Example: a loop inside another loop.
Used for patterns and tables.

13. Function in C++

A function is a block of code used to perform a specific task.
Declaration tells the function name and parameters.
Definition contains the actual logic of the function.
Calling a function executes its code.

14. Scope of variables in C++

Scope defines where a variable can be accessed.
Local variables are declared inside a function.
They can be used only within that function.
Global variables are declared outside all functions.

15. Recursion in C++

Recursion is when a function calls itself.
It is used for repetitive problems like factorial.
A base condition is required to stop recursion.
Example: fact(n) = n * fact(n-1).

16. Function prototypes in C++

A function prototype declares a function before use.
It specifies return type and parameters.
Written before the main() function.
It helps avoid compilation errors.

17. Arrays in C++

An array is a collection of elements of the same data type.
A single-dimensional array stores data in a linear form.
A multi-dimensional array stores data in table or matrix form.
Example: int a[5]; and int b[2][2];

18. String handling in C++

Strings are used to store text data.
C++ supports strings using string class and character arrays.
cin and getline() are used for input.
Example: string name = "Akash";

19. Array initialization in C++

Arrays can be initialized at the time of declaration.
1D array example: int a[3] = {1,2,3};
2D array example: int b[2][2] = {{1,2},{3,4}};
Values are stored in indexed form.

20. String operations and functions

String operations include length, compare, and concatenation.
Common functions are length(), append(), and compare().
C++ also supports + operator for joining strings.
Example: s1 + s2;

21. Key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

OOP is a programming approach based on objects.
Main concepts are class, object, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
It helps organize code in a real-world manner.
OOP improves code reusability and security.
It makes programs easier to maintain.

22. Classes and objects in C++

A class is a blueprint for creating objects.
It contains data members and member functions.
An object is an instance of a class.
Objects access the class members.
Example: class Car { int speed; }; Car c;

23. Inheritance in C++

Inheritance allows one class to acquire properties of another class.
The existing class is called the base class.
The new class is called the derived class.
It promotes code reusability.
Example: class Student : public Person { };

24. Encapsulation in C++

Encapsulation means binding data and methods together.
It protects data from unauthorized access.
Achieved using access specifiers like private and public.
Data members are kept private.
Functions are used to access them.
